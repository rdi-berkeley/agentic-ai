## Course Description

Agentic AI is the new frontier and poised to transform the future of our daily life with the support of intelligent task automation and personalization. In this course, we will first discuss fundamental concepts that are essential for Agentic AI, including the foundation of LLMs, reasonsing, planning, agentic frameworks and infrastructure. We will also cover representative agent applications, including code generation, robotics, web automation, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, we will discuss limitations and potential risks of current LLM agents, and share insights into directions for further improvement.
